## Нэгдүгээр ангийн онлайн гэрийн сургуулийн математикийн сургалтын хөтөлбөр

A first grade math curriculum should teach students the fundamentals in a way that is not just effective, but also fun. In addition to giving students a solid foundation, first grade math fluency also arms students with the tools and confidence they need to learn more advanced concepts down the road.

If a child can’t keep up with a first grade math curriculum, not only will they fall behind and, in turn, lose confidence, but they’ll also lose interest in the subject. Additionally, the skills and concepts that students learn in first grade math aren’t just limited to use in their academic studies. First grade math fluency also helps students become better problem solvers and logical thinkers.

## 1-р ангийн сурагч математикийн талаар юу мэдэх ёстой вэ

Students will acquire tons of new math skills in first grade. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for what they will learn in second grade math and also expand on what they learned in kindergarten. As they go into first grade, students should be familiar with a number of concepts in order for them to be successful and learn more advanced topics and math strategies. These include, but are not limited to:

- Be able to count, identify and write numbers
- Perform one-digit addition and subtraction
- Have an understanding of quantity (more and less)
- Familiarity with patterns and shapes
- Knowledge of place value (ones, tens, etc.)

The ideal math curriculum for first grade should not only build on these skills and ensure mastery of new concepts, but also make learning fun by engaging and motivating students.

## 1-р ангийн математикийн зорилтууд
Once you’ve selected the ideal math curriculum, it is important to set some attainable goals. Below is a sample of what some of these math goals should be:

- Count to 100; county by 5s and 10s to 100; count by 2s to 40
- Represent numbers on a number line
- Add and subtract 2-digit numbers
- Write the date; tell time; read a calendar
- Count and create coin combinations; add and subtract money
- Identify, sort and classify 2-dimensional shapes
- Understanding the value of money
 
Towards the end of the year, if your child has already achieved most of their first grade math goals you can give them a head start for the next year by having them practice math facts. This will solidify what they learned in first grade and prepare them for their second grade math learning targets.
