1st Grade Math Curriculum

This year, your student will begin to grasp how mathematics is everywhere around them. In first grade, students work with whole numbers and place value as they learn to add and subtract up through 20. They will develop number sense as they count and compare quantities, describe situations mathematically, and describe objects.

When choosing a math curriculum for first grade, look for a program that encourages your child’s natural curiosity about numbers in their world. It should also help students create a “math mindset”–a belief that they can do math. With  interactive, multimedia-based lessons that feature colorful animations, funny characters, and catchy songs, Time4Learning’s 1st grade math curriculum gets students excited about learning.

Some of the goals your first grade math student will aim for include:

Be able to count, identify and write numbers
Perform one-digit addition and subtraction
Have an understanding of quantity (more and less)
Familiarity with patterns and shapes
Knowledge of place value (ones, tens, etc.)
